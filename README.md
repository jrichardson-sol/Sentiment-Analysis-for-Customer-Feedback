# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Customer-Feedback
Goal: Create a simple AI tool that categorizes customer feedback (e.g., from reviews, social media comments, or emails) into positive, negative, or neutral sentimen
# Sentiment Analyzer for Customer Feedback

A simple sentiment analysis tool that classifies customer feedback into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories. This project uses Python and the `TextBlob` library, making it easy to get started with natural language processing (NLP).

## Features
- Analyzes customer feedback to determine sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- Uses a basic dataset for demonstration purposes (can be replaced with real customer reviews or comments).
- Outputs results in a structured table and saves them to a CSV file.

| Customer Feedback                                 | Sentiment |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| I love this product! It's amazing and works perfectly. | Positive  |
| Terrible experience, it broke after a week of use.       | Negative  |
| The service was okay, not great but not bad either.      | Neutral   |
Customization
Replace the Dataset
Replace the sample data with your actual dataset (e.g., customer reviews, comments from social media, etc.). You can load a CSV file or integrate APIs for live data.

Enhance with Visualization
Add visualizations using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to create pie charts, bar graphs, or other data visualizations.

Build a Web Interface
Use Streamlit or Flask to create a user-friendly interface where users can upload feedback files or type their own feedback for analysis.
